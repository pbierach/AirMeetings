# About 
Flask web-app that allows users to book rooms for upcoming meetings (i.e. website like AirBnB but for meetings) 

# Technology Used
  - Python3
    - Flask
  - SQLite
  - CSS
  - OpenStreetMaps API
  
# Additional Information
This was a final project for Ithaca College's Advanced Web Programming class (COMP205). The purpose of the project was to create a web-app from scratch using Flask based on an original idea. The project features several routes, forms, and templates complete with CSS styles. All user and space data is kept in a SQLite database which gets updated in the background of the app. The OpenStreetMaps API was used to display the location of a certain space on its page.

# Future Work
This is detailed in the final project report but will be repeated here:
 - Incorporate scheduling via a visual calendar
 - Allow users to cancel meetings or edit meeting details 
 - Different interfaces and actions for designated “host” accounts
 - Ability to create group meetings (i.e. one meeting linked to many users)
 - "Cart" for multiple meetings
